# test_DeepReg

In this project, two ways of prediction Transcription Factor identity from sequences are compared. One is based on the predicted Pfam domains, and has been carried out before. The other is DeepReg, which can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/LeonardoLed/DeepLearning-_TF).

The Data folder contains all the predicted genes' protein sequences from Ophiocordyceps camponoti-floridani and the Pfam-predicted TF's, downloaded from the [Fungal Genomics Portal](https://fungalgenomics.science.uu.nl/portal/ophcf2/)
It also contains the output file from DeepReg, containing their predicted TF's with confidence scores.
